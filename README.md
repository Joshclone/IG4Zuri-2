Using JavaScript, create a "date-matching" application that has the following features:  Three lists containing names (Group A, Group B and Places), the list can be represented with Object or Array.  The application should randomly match and produce 2 people at each refresh.  The result produced should be in the format: Group A['name'] and Group B['name'] will be going on a dinner date at Places['name']. However, the program should go through the entire list in Group A before repeating names .
